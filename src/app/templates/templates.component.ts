    `<p>Dear</p>
  <p>I hope you're doing well.</p>
  <p>I've recently come across your agency on Upwork and was impressed by the work you're doing. As a skilled freelancer with experience in Mean stack, I believe my skills and background would be a great fit for your team.</p>
  <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities to collaborate with agencies like yours, where I can contribute my expertise and work on exciting projects. Iâ€™d love to join your team and contribute to the success of your clients while continuing to grow professionally.</p>
  <p>If you're open to it, I would appreciate the chance to schedule a brief call to introduce myself, share my portfolio, and discuss how I can add value to your agency's efforts. Please let me know a convenient time for you, and we can arrange a meeting via Zoom, Skype, or Google Meet, whichever works best for you.</p>
  <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to connect with you soon!</p>
  <p>Best regards,</p>
  <p>QueenQuarry Team</p>`,
